            Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick; 
            But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters 
            And well consider of them. Make good speed. Exit page 
            How many thousands of my poorest subjects 
            Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep, 
            Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee, 
            That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down, 
            And steep my senses in forgetfulness? 
            Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs, 
            Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee, 
            And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber, 
            Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great, 
            Under the canopies of costly state, 
            And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody? 
            O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile 
            In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch 
            A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell? 
            Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast 
            Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains 
            In cradle of the rude imperious surge, 
            And in the visitation of the winds, 
            Who take the ruffian billows by the top, 
            Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them 
            With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds, 
            That with the hurly death itself awakes? 
            Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose 
            To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude; 
            And in the calmest and most stillest night, 
            With all appliances and means to boot, 
            Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down! 
            Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

            What's he that wishes so?
            My cousin, Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin;
            If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
            To do our country loss; and if to live,
            The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
            God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
            By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
            Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
            It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
            Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
            But if it be a sin to covet honour,
            I am the most offending soul alive.
            No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
            God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
            As one man more methinks would share from me
            For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
            Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
            That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
            Let him depart; his passport shall be made,
            And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
            We would not die in that man's company
            That fears his fellowship to die with us.
            This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.
            He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
            Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
            And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
            He that shall live this day, and see old age,
            Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
            And say "To-morrow is Saint Crispian."
            Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
            And say "These wounds I had on Crispin's day."
            Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
            But he'll remember, with advantages,
            What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
            Familiar in his mouth as household words—
            Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
            Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—
            Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.
            This story shall the good man teach his son;
            And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
            From this day to the ending of the world,
            But we in it shall be rememberèd-
            We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
            For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
            Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
            This day shall gentle his condition;
            And gentlemen in England now a-bed
            Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
            And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
            That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

            Go where glory waits thee,
            But while fame elates thee,
                Oh! still remember me.
            When the praise thou meetest
            To thine ear is sweetest,
                Oh! then remember me.
            Other arms may press thee,
            Dearer friends caress thee,
            All the joys that bless thee,
                Sweeter far may be;
            But when friends are nearest,
            And when joys are dearest,
                Oh! then remember me!

            When, at eve, thou rovest
            By the star thou lovest,
                Oh! then remember me.
            Think, when home returning,
            Bright we've seen it burning,
                Oh! thus remember me.
            Oft as summer closes,
            When thine eye reposes
            On its lingering roses,
                Once so loved by thee,
            Think of her who wove them,
            Her who made thee love them,
                Oh! then, remember me.

            When, around thee dying,
            Autumn leaves are lying,
                Oh! then remember me.
            And, at night, when gazing
            On the gay hearth blazing,
                Oh! still remember me.
            Then should music, stealing
            All the soul of feeling,
            To thy heart appealing,
                Draw one tear from thee;
            Then let memory bring thee
            Strains I used to sing thee,--
                Oh! then remember me.
